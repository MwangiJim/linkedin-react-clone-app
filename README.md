This is a Linkedin clone by React.js.I built this clone in an effort to grasp Redux
which comes in handy in storing state globally in the application and enabling
implementation of posting messages just like in a normal
Linkedin web application
Authentication is also inclusive through Firebase.I decided to use SignInWithGoogle
to make the application even much better
